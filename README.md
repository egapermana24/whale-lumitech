# Getting Started

Our application currently only supports Android devices, so to run the code, please use an Android emulator or an Android device with debugging mode.

Type in the terminal at this project location (depending on where you save it after downloading):

```dart
flutter pub get
```

after that

```dart
flutter run
```

#### Because when debugging requires SHA-1 and SHA-256 on each local computer which is then placed in our application's Firebase, it's best to just download the ready-made application if you want to check.
